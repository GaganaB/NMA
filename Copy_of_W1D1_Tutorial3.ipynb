        "\n",
        "In his foundational [1948 paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) on information theory, Claude Shannon began with three criteria for a function $H$ defining the entropy of a discrete distribution of probability masses $p_i\\in p(X)$ over the points $x_i\\in X$:\n",
        "1. $H$ should be continuous in the $p_i$. \n",
        "  - That is, $H$ should change smoothly in response to smooth changes to the mass $p_i$ on each point $x_i$.\n",
        "2. If all the points have equal shares of the probability mass, $p_i=1/N$, $H$ should be a non-decreasing function of $N$. \n",
        "  - That is, if $X_N$ is the support with $N$ discrete points and $p(x\\in X_N)$ assigns constant mass to each point, then $H(X_1) < H(X_2) < H(X_3) < \\dots$\n",
        "3. $H$ should be preserved by (invariant to) the equivalent (de)composition of distributions.\n",
        "  - For example (from Shannon's paper) if we have a discrete distribution over three points with masses $(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{6})$, then their entropy can be represented in terms of a direct choice between the three and calculated $H(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{6})$. However, it could also be represented in terms of a series of two choices: \n",
        "    1. either we sample the point with mass $1/2$ or not (_not_ is the other $1/2$, whose subdivisions are not given in the first choice), \n",
        "    2. if (with probability $1/2$) we _don't_ sample the first point, we sample one of the two remaining points, masses $1/3$ and $1/6$.\n",
