### TAing101
1. <b>Going unprepared could spell disaster</b>:  
The students are counting on your experience so, look through the tutorials beforehand.  
If you really don't have time on a particular day, at least glance through the tutorials so, you're not caught by surprise.

2. <b>Be kind to yourself</b>:  
With content so diverse, it's impossible to be an expert on everything.  
Accept that you don't know, tell your students that you will get back to them and <b>keep your word</b>.

3. <b>Take the precourse seriously</b>:  
Look up the precourse content as they might help further in making neural correlates when necessary during the course.  
Or least, help you "get in the zone".

4. <b>Form an internal support system</b>:  
Your pod relies on you and at times, its' okay for you to rely on them too. 

5. <b>Take your creative self to work</b>:  
Try to form unusual connections between concepts and get the students to understand why they're doing what they're doing.  
And to be creative, sometimes [All you need to do isâ€¦ nothing](http://www.brigidschulte.com/books/overhelmed/).

6. <b>Be attentive</b>:   
Watch the non-verbal atmosphere of the day.  
If the students are bored/exhausted, try to brighten the day by engaging with them.
> One secret of leadership is that the mind of a leader never turns off. Leaders even they are 
> sightseers or spectators, are active; not passive observers.
~ James Humes

7. <b> Take care </b>:  
The most important thing you can do is take care of yourself. If you're turn up tired, there's no way your students can be excited! 

<b> Special Note: Introvert TA's! </b> Being around people all day is no easy feat. Take time away from screens and curl with music or books every day 
after hours. Communicate with your students if and when necessary!
