### TAing101
1. <b>Going unprepared could spell disaster</b>:  
The students are counting on your experience so, look through the tutorials beforehand.  
If you really don't have time on a particular day, at least glance through the tutorials so, you're not caught by surprise.

2. <b>Be kind to yourself</b>:
With content so diverse, it's impossible to be an expert on everything.  
Accept that you don't know, tell your students that you will get back to them and <b>keep your word</b>.

3. <b>Take the precourse seriously</b>:
Look up the precourse content as they might help further in making neural correlates when necessary during the course.  
Or least, help you "get in the zone".
