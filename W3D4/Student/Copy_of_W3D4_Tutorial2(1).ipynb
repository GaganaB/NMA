        "- as a function of the number of operations that they perform vs as a function of their performance on imagenet.\n",
        "=> each of these different networks is proportional to the number of parameters\n",
        "that each of these networks has.\n",
        "\n",
        "- You can use L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
        "You can also use a technique called batch\n",
        "normalization and this helps to keep your activations at a similar size and distribution across layers to improve optimization.\n",
        "It's especially important if you have very deep networks.\n",
        "We can also\n",
        "use a technique called dropout which randomly removes units from the network during training\n",
        "but this approach is not used so often anymore.\n",
        "\n",
        "- And then finally, you can just reduce the number of parameters by using techniques like using convolutions. \n",
        "\n",

        " which is going to be our squared error loss term plus an additional term\n",
        "which is a penalty on the norm of the weights.\n",
        "And this prevents the weights from being large and potentially just being large to fit some noisy aspects of the training data.\n",
        "So if we differentiate this cost function\n",
        "we get the the first term which is our usual gradient of the loss function with respect to our weight W,\n",

        "so you're going to be pushing that weight up so whether you're positive or negative\n",
        "these weights are going to get shrunk to zero and that's why this type of regularization is called weight decay.\n",

        "which is what we do in this case where we take the weights of our linear layer and we add this L2 penalty,\n",
        "which is going to be squaring the weights and then summing them.\n",
        "\n",
        "- L1 regularization adds a penalty which is the sum of the absolute value of the weights\n",

        "## Why CNN's?\n",
        "\n",
        "CNN models are particularly [well-suited](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4244) to modeling the visual system for a number of reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Distributed computation**: like any other neural network, CNN's use distributed representations to compute -- much like the brain seems to do. Such models, therefore, provide us with a vocabulary with which to talk and think about such distributed representations. Because we know the exact function the model is built to perform (e.g. orientation discrimination), we can analyze its internal representations with respect to this function and begin to interpret why the representations look the way they do. Most importantly, we can then use these insights to analyze the structure of neural representations observed in recorded population activity. We can qualitatively and quantitatively compare the representations we see in the model and in a given population of real neurons to hopefully tease out the computations it performs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hierarchical architecture**: like in any other deep learning architecture, each layer of a deep CNN comprises a non-linear transformation of the previous layer. Thus, there is a natural hierarchy whereby layers closer to the network output represent increasingly more abstract information about the input image. For example, in a network trained to do object recognition, the early layers might represent information about edges in the image, whereas later layers closer to the output might represent various object categories. This resembles the [hierarchical structure of the visual system](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1822724/), where [lower-level areas](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/46/10577.short) (e.g. retina, V1) represent visual features of the sensory input and [higher-level areas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662731200092X) (e.g. V4, IT) represent properties of objects in the visual scene. We can then naturally use a single CNN to model multiple visual areas, using early CNN layers to model lower-level visual areas and late CNN layers to model higher-level visual areas.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Relative to fully connected networks, CNN's, in fact, have further hierarchical structure built-in through the max pooling layers. Recall that each output of a convolution + pooling block is the result of processing a local patch of the inputs to that block. If we stack such blocks in a sequence, then the outputs of each block will be sensitive to increasingly larger regions of the initial raw input to the network: an output from the first block is sensitive to a single patch of these inputs, corresponding to its \"receptive field\"; an output from the second block is sensitive to a patch of outputs from the first block, which together are sensitive to a larger patch of raw inputs comprising the union of their receptive fields. Receptive fields thus get larger for deeper layers (see [here](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Conv-Nets-Modular/) for a nice visual depiction of this). This resembles primate visual systems, where neurons in higher-level visual areas respond to stimuli in wider regions of the visual field than neurons in lower-level visual areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Convolutional layers**: through the weight sharing constraint, the outputs of each channel of a convolutional layer process different parts of the input image in exactly the same way. This architectural constraint effectively builds into the network the assumption that objects in the world typically look the same regardless of where they are in space. This is useful for modeling the visual system for two (largely separate) reasons:\n",
        "  * Firstly, this assumption is generally valid in mammalian visual systems, since mammals tend to view the same object from many perspectives. Two neurons at a similar hierarchy in the visual system with different receptive fields could thus end up receiving statistically similar synaptic inputs, so that the synaptic weights developed over time may end up being similar as well.\n",
        "  * Secondly, this architecture significantly improves object recognition ability. Object recognition was essentially an unsolved problem in machine learning until the [advent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet) of techniques for effectively training *deep* convolutional neural networks. Fully connected networks on their own can't achieve object recognition abilities anywhere close to human levels, making them bad models of human object recognition. Indeed, it is generally the case that [the better a neural network model is at object recognition, the closer the match between its representations and those observed in the brain](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8619.short). That said, it is worth noting that our much simpler orientation discrimination task (in Tutorial 3) can be solved by relatively simple networks."
