We'll finish our exploration of regression models by generalizing to multiple linear regression and polynomial regression (Tutorial 4). We end by learning how to choose between these various models. We discuss the bias-variance trade-off (Tutorial 5) and Cross Validation for model selection (Tutorial 6).\n",

The most direct approach is to compute percentiles from the empirical distribution of bootstrapped estimates. Note that this is widely applicable as we are not assuming that this empirical distribution is Gaussian."
