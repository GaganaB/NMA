        "The brain is a complex system, not because it is composed of a large number of diverse types of neurons, but mainly because of how neurons are connected to each other. The brain is indeed a network of highly specialized neuronal networks. \n",
        "\n",
        "The activity of a neural network constantly evolves in time. For this reason, neurons can be modeled as dynamical systems. The dynamical system approach is only one of the many modeling approaches that computational neuroscientists have developed (other points of view include information processing,  statistical models, etc.). \n",
        "\n",
        "How the dynamics of neuronal networks affect the representation and processing of information in the brain is an open question. However, signatures of altered brain dynamics present in many brain diseases (e.g., in epilepsy or Parkinson's disease) tell us that it is crucial to study network activity dynamics if we want to understand the brain.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will simulate and study one of the simplest models of biological neuronal networks. Instead of modeling and simulating individual excitatory neurons (e.g., LIF models that you implemented yesterday), we will treat them as a single homogeneous population and approximate their dynamics using a single one-dimensional equation describing the evolution of their average spiking rate in time.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a firing rate model of a single population of excitatory neurons. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps:**\n",
        "- Write the equation for the firing rate dynamics of a 1D excitatory population.\n",
        "- Visualize the response of the population as a function of parameters such as threshold level and gain, using the frequency-current (F-I) curve.\n",
        "- Numerically simulate the dynamics of the excitatory population and find the fixed points of the system. \n",
